Community
=========

The most important thing for a successful Open Source project is a vibrant
community.  This part of the webpage tries to connect Babel users all
over the world, to exchange their experiences and to help each other.

IRC Channel
-----------

Babel is now one of the `Pocoo`_ libraries and uses the ``#pocoo`` channel
on irc.freenode.net for both development specific questions and user
support.

You need an IRC Client to join it. The following clients are widely known and used:

-   `Pidgin <http://pidgin.im/>`_, Windows, Linux, OS X
-   `X-Chat <http://xchat.org/>`_, Linux
-   `mirc <http://mirc.com/>`_, Windows
-   `colloquy <http://colloquy.info/>`_, OS X

We also have a bot in the channel that logs the conversations. You can
have a look at older discussions `in the logs <http://dev.pocoo.org/irclogs/>`_.

Mailing List
------------

If you prefer discussions or support via e-mail you can use the `pocoo-libs
mailinglist <http://groups.google.com/group/pocoo-libs>`_.
